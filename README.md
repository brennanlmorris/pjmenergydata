Energy Consumption Analysis Project

Overview

This project analyzes historical energy consumption data from American Electric Power (AEP) from 2004 to 2018. The analysis focuses on understanding load patterns, seasonal variations, and system utilization through various statistical methods and visualizations.

Dataset

- Source: AEP hourly energy consumption data

- Time Period: 2004-2018

- Variables: Datetime and energy consumption (MW)

- Size: 121,273 hourly observations

Key Analyses

1. Time-Based Patterns

- Peak usage occurs at 19:00 (7 PM)

- Minimum usage occurs at 04:00 (4 AM)

- Clear distinction between peak hours (7 AM - 11 PM) and off-peak hours

- Statistically significant difference between peak and off-peak consumption (t-test p-value < 0.05)

2. Seasonal Analysis
Average consumption by season:

- Winter: 16,598 MW

- Summer: 15,837 MW

- Fall: 15,107 MW

- Spring: 14,482 MW

Seasonal patterns show statistically significant differences (ANOVA F-stat: 4183.76, p-value < 0.001)

3. Load Duration Curve Analysis
System Metrics:

- Peak Load: 25,695 MW

- Base Load: 9,581 MW

- Average Load: 15,499 MW

- Load Factor: 60.32%

4. Load Distribution:

- 90th percentile: 19,064 MW
- Median Load: 15,310 MW
- 10th percentile: 12,197 MW

Key Findings:

- Extreme peaks (>90% of peak load) occur only 0.26% of the time

- System operates above 80% of peak load 3.63% of the time

- Load exceeds average 46.92% of the time

1. Long-Term Trends

- Overall declining trend in energy consumption from 2004 to 2018

- Significant year-to-year variations observed

- Notable decline during 2009 (-7.76% compared to previous year)

- Despite some yearly increases, the long-term trajectory shows a general downward trend

- This decline suggests possible improvements in energy efficiency or changes in consumption patterns

2. Technical Implementation

Language: Python

Key Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, statsmodels

Statistical Methods: T-tests, ANOVA, Tukey's HSD, seasonal decomposition

3. Key Insights

- System Efficiency: Load factor of 60.32% indicates moderate system efficiency, typical for utility operations

- Capacity Utilization: System requires significant flexible capacity (~10,000 MW) to handle variations

- Peak Management: Rare occurrence of extreme peaks suggests potential for demand response programs

- Seasonal Patterns: Winter shows highest consumption, with significant variations across seasons

4. Potential Applications

- Capacity planning optimization

- Peak load management strategies

- Seasonal demand forecasting

- Energy efficiency program development

- Rate structure design

5. Future Work

- Integration of weather data for deeper analysis

- Economic impact analysis of load patterns

- Grid reliability metrics

- Detailed ramp rate analysis
